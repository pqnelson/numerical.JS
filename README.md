# Introduction

A basic library for numerical analysis in JavaScript, mostly for my 
own enjoyment.

I tried writing it for efficiency, but also style. It's unit tested 
and commented.

For offline development, I have been using `Node.js`.

# Dependencies

Unit testing is handled with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), 
mostly offline...so with 
[jasmine-node](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node) to be precise.
